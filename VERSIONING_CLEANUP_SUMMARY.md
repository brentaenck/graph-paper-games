# Graph Paper Games - Versioning Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the versioning cleanup performed on 2025-10-17 to address inconsistencies and improve version management practices.

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### ✅ 1. Sprouts Version Inconsistency
**Problem**: CHANGELOG.md claimed Sprouts was released as v1.0.0 in release 0.7.0, but package.json showed v0.1.0.

**Analysis**: Examination of Sprouts implementation revealed:
- Complete game engine with full GameEngineAPI implementation
- Advanced AI system with 6 difficulty levels
- React component for interactive gameplay
- Comprehensive geometric utilities for curve operations
- Full test coverage and TypeScript types
- Production-ready features matching CHANGELOG description

**Resolution**: Updated `games/sprouts/package.json` from version 0.1.0 → 1.0.0 to match CHANGELOG and actual implementation maturity.

### ✅ 2. Confusing v1.2.0 Tag
**Problem**: Git tag v1.2.0 existed but current development was at v0.7.0, creating confusion about project state.

**Analysis**: 
- Tag pointed to commit `d50ed34` with Visual Style Lab research code
- This research code was later cleaned up and integrated into framework
- Tag represented obsolete experimental code, not a production release

**Resolution**: Removed v1.2.0 tag to eliminate confusion and maintain clean version history.

### ✅ 3. Inconsistent Tag Naming
**Problem**: Tag `framework-v0.4.2` used different naming convention than standard `vX.Y.Z` pattern.

**Analysis**: 
- All other tags follow `vX.Y.Z` format
- Framework-specific tag was inconsistent with monorepo versioning strategy
- Tag pointed to framework-only version bump that was later synchronized

**Resolution**: Removed `framework-v0.4.2` tag to maintain consistent `vX.Y.Z` naming convention.

### ✅ 4. Release Script Misaligned with Git Flow
**Problem**: Release script expected `develop` branch but project uses simplified GitHub Flow with `main` branch.

**Analysis**: 
- Project WARP rules specify simplified GitHub Flow for rapid development
- Script assumed Git Flow branching strategy
- Instructions referenced develop branch that doesn't exist in current workflow

**Resolution**: Updated `scripts/release.sh`:
- Changed branch check from `develop` → `main`
- Removed references to merging back to develop
- Simplified release instructions to match GitHub Flow
- Fixed duplicate push command in release instructions

## Current Version State (After Cleanup)

### Core Framework (Synchronized)
```
@gpg/root: 0.7.0
@gpg/apps-web: 0.7.0  
@gpg/framework: 0.7.0
@gpg/shared: 0.7.0
```

### Games (Independent Versioning)
```
@gpg/dots-and-boxes: 1.0.0 ✅ (Production Ready)
@gpg/tic-tac-toe: 0.2.0 ✅ (Feature Complete)
@gpg/sprouts: 1.0.0 ✅ (Production Ready - Now Consistent)
```

### Git Tags (Clean)
```
v0.7.0 (latest, matches current development)
v0.6.2, v0.6.1, v0.6.0, v0.5.0
v0.4.3, v0.4.2, v0.4.1, v0.4.0
v0.3.1, v0.3.0, v0.2.3, v0.2.1, v0.2.0, v0.1.0
```

## Versioning Strategy Confirmation

The project follows a **hybrid monorepo versioning strategy**:

1. **Core Framework Synchronization**: Core packages (root, apps-web, framework, shared) maintain synchronized versions
2. **Independent Game Versioning**: Individual games version independently based on their maturity and feature completeness
3. **Semantic Versioning**: All packages follow SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
4. **Release Automation**: Professional release script with quality gates and automated version management

## Quality Verification

Post-cleanup verification confirms:
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All ESLint checks pass (with pre-existing warnings only)
- ✅ Package versions are consistent with CHANGELOG
- ✅ Git tags follow consistent naming convention
- ✅ Release script aligns with project workflow

## Recommendations for Future Releases

1. **Use Release Script**: Always use `scripts/release.sh` for version updates to maintain consistency
2. **Update CHANGELOG First**: Write CHANGELOG entries before running release script
3. **Verify Version Consistency**: After releases, verify package.json versions match CHANGELOG claims
4. **Follow SemVer**: Continue using semantic versioning for all packages
5. **Independent Game Versioning**: Continue allowing games to version independently based on their maturity

## Files Modified

- `games/sprouts/package.json` - Version updated 0.1.0 → 1.0.0
- `scripts/release.sh` - Updated for GitHub Flow (develop → main branch)
- Git tags removed: `v1.2.0`, `framework-v0.4.2`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check current versions
find . -name "package.json" -not -path "./node_modules/*" | xargs grep '"version"'

# Check git tags
git tag --list --sort=-version:refname

# Verify build/lint
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint
```

This cleanup ensures the project maintains professional versioning practices with clear, consistent version management that accurately reflects the maturity and state of each component.
