# Graph Paper Games - Project Overview

## Vision Statement
Create a web-based gaming platform that brings classic graph paper and pencil games to the digital world, providing a unified gaming experience through a shared framework and game hub.

## Core Concept
A suite of turn-based games inspired by traditional pencil-and-paper games that were commonly played on graph paper. The platform will feature both single-player and multiplayer experiences with AI opponents available for all games.

## Key Features

### Game Hub
- Central launcher for accessing all available games
- User profiles and statistics tracking
- Game history and saved states
- Social features (friends, leaderboards)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### Shared Game Framework
- Consistent visual design and user interface
- Common game mechanics (turn management, scoring, etc.)
- Standardized grid/graph paper rendering system
- Shared animation and transition libraries
- Common UI components (buttons, dialogs, menus)

### Turn-Based Gaming System
- Real-time multiplayer support
- Asynchronous play options (play-by-email style)
- Game state persistence and restoration
- Move validation and game rule enforcement
- Spectator mode for ongoing games

### AI Player System
- Configurable difficulty levels
- Game-specific AI implementations
- Different AI personalities/strategies per game
- Training mode with hints and suggestions

## Target Games (Initial Set)
