# SDLC Strategy for Graph Paper Games

## Recommended SDLC Approach: Modified GitFlow + Community-First

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency**: All development happens in the open
2. **Accessibility**: Low barrier to entry for new contributors
3. **Quality**: Automated checks prevent regressions
4. **Collaboration**: Clear processes for community input and contribution

## Branching Strategy: Simplified GitFlow

### Branch Structure

```
main (production-ready)
├── develop (integration branch)
├── feature/* (new features)
├── game/* (new games)
├── hotfix/* (urgent fixes)
└── release/* (release preparation)
```

### Branch Rules

- **main**: Always deployable, protected, requires PR + reviews
- **develop**: Integration branch, auto-deployed to staging
- **feature/\***: Short-lived, merge to develop via PR
- **game/\***: New game implementations, can be long-lived
- **hotfix/\***: Critical fixes, can merge directly to main
- **release/\***: Release preparation, version bumping, final testing

## Development Workflow

### 1. Issue-Driven Development

```
GitHub Issue → Branch → PR → Review → Merge → Deploy
```

**Issue Types:**

- 🐛 Bug Report
- ✨ Feature Request
- 🎮 New Game
- 📚 Documentation
- 🏗️ Infrastructure
- 🤝 Good First Issue
- 🔧 Maintenance

### 2. Pull Request Process

**Required Checks:**

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Code coverage maintained (80%+)
- ✅ At least 1 reviewer approval
- ✅ No merge conflicts

**PR Templates:**

- Feature PR template with checklist
- Game PR template with specific game requirements
- Documentation PR template

### 3. Release Process

**Semantic Versioning (semver):**

- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- MAJOR: Breaking framework changes
- MINOR: New games, new features
- PATCH: Bug fixes, minor improvements

**Release Cycle:**

- **Regular releases**: Every 2-3 weeks
- **Hotfixes**: As needed
- **Major releases**: Framework breaking changes (quarterly)

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Automated Testing Pyramid

```
         /\
        /  \  Unit Tests (70%)
       /    \
      /      \  Integration Tests (20%)
     /        \
    /__________\  E2E Tests (10%)
```

**Testing Requirements:**

- **Unit Tests**: All framework components, game logic
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, game state transitions
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows, multiplayer scenarios
- **Visual Tests**: UI consistency across games (Chromatic/Percy)

### Code Quality Tools

- **ESLint**: Code linting with community TypeScript rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting (enforced)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **SonarCloud**: Code quality analysis and security scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Security vulnerability scanning

## Community Governance

### Contribution Levels

1. **Contributor**: Anyone who submits PRs
2. **Regular Contributor**: 5+ merged PRs
3. **Maintainer**: Commit access, can review/merge PRs
4. **Core Team**: Project direction, release decisions

### Decision Making Process

- **Core Features**: RFC (Request for Comments) process
- **New Games**: Community proposals with implementation commitment
- **Breaking Changes**: Core team consensus + community feedback period
- **Minor Changes**: Standard PR process

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Discussions**: Feature requests, general discussion
- **Discord Server**: Real-time chat, community building
- **Monthly Community Calls**: Progress updates, Q&A
- **RFC Repository**: Major feature proposals

## Documentation Strategy

### Required Documentation

1. **README**: Project overview, quick start
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution guidelines
3. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Community standards
4. **docs/**: Technical documentation
5. **Game READMEs**: Rules, implementation notes
6. **API Documentation**: Auto-generated from code

### Documentation Standards

- **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**: Major technical decisions
- **Changelog**: Release notes and migration guides
- **Tutorial Content**: Getting started guides for contributors

## Development Environment

### Developer Onboarding

```bash
# One-command setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/graph-paper-games.git
cd graph-paper-games
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Development Tools

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud development environment

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

#### On Pull Request:

```yaml
- Lint and format check
- TypeScript compilation
- Unit and integration tests
- Build verification
- Security scanning
- Performance regression tests
```

#### On Merge to Develop:

```yaml
- Full test suite
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run E2E tests
- Update documentation site
```

#### On Release:

```yaml
- Create release notes
- Deploy to production
- Publish packages to npm
- Update demo site
- Notify community
```

## Security Strategy

### Security Practices

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevent credential commits
- **SAST**: Static application security testing
- **Security Headers**: Proper CSP, HSTS configuration
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs

### Vulnerability Response

1. **Report**: security@graphpapergames.dev
2. **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
3. **Assessment**: 72 hours
4. **Fix**: Based on severity (Critical: 7 days)
