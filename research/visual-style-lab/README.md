# Graph Paper Games - Visual Style Research Lab

A dedicated research environment for experimenting with hand-drawn, graph paper-inspired visual aesthetics for the Graph Paper Games project.

## üéØ Purpose

This standalone research lab allows us to develop and validate a **dual design system** approach:

- **Experiment** with combining modern UI and hand-drawn aesthetics
- **Test** the boundaries between digital interface and game elements
- **Prototype** the "looking down at paper" game experience
- **Validate** that dual styling improves UX over single approaches
- **Develop** production-ready design system for the main framework

## üé® Visual Concept

### **Dual Design System Approach**

We're researching a **dual design system** that combines:
1. **Modern UI** for digital interface elements (navigation, settings, controls)
2. **Hand-drawn aesthetics** for game elements on the "paper"

This creates the feeling of using a modern app to look down at a real pencil-and-paper game:

### Key Design Elements

- **Graph Paper Backgrounds** - Various grid styles (fine, standard, engineering, dot grid)
- **Hand-drawn Typography** - Using Google Fonts: Kalam, Indie Flower, Caveat
- **Sketch-style Borders** - Multi-layer borders with slight rotations for authentic feel
- **Authentic Color Palette** - Based on real pen/pencil colors (ink blue, graphite, eraser pink)
- **Subtle Animations** - Hand-drawn appearance effects and wobbly interactions
- **Paper Texture** - Subtle texture overlays to enhance the paper feeling

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üé® Dual Design System

### Modern UI Color Palette
```css
--ui-primary: #2563eb      /* Modern interface primary */
--ui-secondary: #64748b    /* Secondary interface elements */
--ui-success: #059669      /* Success states */
--ui-white: #ffffff        /* Clean backgrounds */
--ui-gray-*: [50-900]      /* Complete gray scale */
```

### Hand-drawn Color Palette
```css
--ink-blue: #1e3a8a        /* Primary blue ink color */
--ink-black: #1f2937       /* Dark text color */
--pencil-graphite: #374151 /* Softer gray text */
--pencil-eraser: #fbbf24   /* Highlight/warning yellow */
--paper-white: #fefefe     /* Clean paper background */
--paper-cream: #fffbf0     /* Warm paper background */
--grid-light-blue: #dbeafe /* Standard grid line color */
```

### Typography

- **Kalam** - Primary handwritten font for body text
- **Indie Flower** - Casual, playful font for secondary elements  
- **Caveat** - Sketchy font for headings and emphasis

### CSS Class System

#### Modern UI Classes (Digital Interface)
- `.ui-button` - Clean, professional button styling
- `.ui-card` - Modern card layouts with subtle shadows
- `.ui-nav` - Navigation bar styling
- `.ui-input` - Form input styling with focus states
- `.ui-badge` - Status indicators and labels
- `.ui-alert` - System notifications

#### Hand-drawn Classes (Game Elements)
- `.sketch-border` - Multi-layer hand-drawn border effect
- `.sketch-button` - Wobbly button with shadow and rotation
- `.hand-x` / `.hand-o` - Styled game symbols with overlays
- `.paper-game-area` - Container for game elements on paper
- `.handwritten` - Kalam font with slight rotation
- `.sketch-underline` - Hand-drawn underline effect

#### Grid & Paper Classes
- `.graph-paper` - Standard graph paper background
- `.graph-paper-small` - Fine grid (10px)
- `.graph-paper-large` - Large grid (24px) 
- `.notebook-lines` - Horizontal ruled lines
- `.paper-texture` - Subtle dot texture overlay

## üî¨ Research Findings (In Progress)

### Dual System Benefits ‚úÖ

- **Clear Functional Hierarchy** - Users intuitively understand interface vs game elements
- **Professional First Impression** - Modern UI creates polished, trustworthy appearance  
- **Enhanced Game Magic** - Hand-drawn elements feel special when contrasted with clean interface
- **Better Usability** - Form inputs and settings are much easier to use with modern UI
- **Flexible Implementation** - Clear CSS class prefixes make development straightforward

### Areas for Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Accessibility Testing** needed for screen readers and high contrast mode
- **Mobile Responsiveness** requires refinement for smaller screens  
- **Animation Performance** should be optimized for lower-end devices
- **Color Contrast** needs validation for WCAG compliance

### Future Enhancements üí°

- **Drawing Animations** - Simulate pen strokes when elements appear
- **Sound Effects** - Paper crinkle, pencil scratching sounds
- **Advanced Grid Types** - Polar coordinates, triangular grids
- **Interactive Eraser** - Animation for clearing/undoing moves
- **Paper Aging Effects** - Subtle yellowing and wear for vintage feel

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start development server (port 3001)
pnpm build      # Build for production
pnpm preview    # Preview production build
pnpm lint       # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck  # Run TypeScript checking
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Refine Color Contrast** - Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards
2. **Mobile Polish** - Improve responsive behavior and touch interactions
3. **Extract Design System** - Create reusable CSS/React components for main framework
4. **Performance Testing** - Validate smooth performance across devices
5. **User Testing** - Get feedback on playability and aesthetic appeal

## üìÅ Integration with Main Project

Once the visual style is refined, the CSS classes and components from this lab will be:

1. **Extracted into** `packages/framework/styles/`
2. **Integrated with** the existing GridRenderer theme system
3. **Applied to** all game components consistently
4. **Extended with** additional game-specific styling
